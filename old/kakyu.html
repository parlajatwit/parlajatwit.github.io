      Kakyuumari was my very first game! I wanted to enter the Ludum Dare game jam because my friends were participating. <br>
      I sought out an artist and a musician from the event's Discord server, then got to work.<br>
      We wanted to make a game that was similar to Katamari Damacy, a game where you push around a sticky ball, picking up objects.<br>
      You can play it <a class="fancy-link" href="https://studionokoi.itch.io/kakyuumari">here</a>. Be warned, it's a bit buggy.
