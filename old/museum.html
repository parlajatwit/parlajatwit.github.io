      <p>
        Museum Madness is a fast-paced minigame compilation. It was made for the <a class="fancy-link" href="https://itch.io/jam/indieware">IndieWare Jam</a>,
        a game jam based around the WarioWare games from Nintendo, scoring 2nd place. <br>
        You can download it <a class="fancy-link" href="https://studionokoi.itch.io/museum-madness">here</a>, or just watch the video below.<br>
        My role was the lead programmer and team leader. I worked with a group of a few artists and musicians, brainstorming minigame ideas with them and outlining art and sound assets to be created for implementation.<br>
        There are around 10 minigames in this game. They range from avoiding COVID at a supermarket to fighting the moon god by throwing axes, all done to try and steal a big gem from a museum.<br>

        Were I given the chance to make this game again, I would choose to use anything but Unity. Unity doesn't have great support for HTML5 exports, so it's not easy to make well-performing web games with it.<br>
        When doing a game jam, most users tend not to download any executables. They would rather play a game in their browser, which seems to be the future for small, free games. <br>
        I would love to revisit this concept, rewriting it in GameMaker Studio 2 or a JavaScript game engine I've been chipping away at.
