        American Ballfrog was my submission to the Ballfrog animation contest on Newgrounds. It won <a class="fancy-link" href="https://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic/1495257">first place</a>, with a cash prize.<br>
        On this project, I wrote the script, created and animated the characters, did some prop design for the set, and edited audio.<br>

        The idea to make this short be an American Psycho parody stemmed from wanting to make something <i>different</i>. I figured most of
        the other entries would be tame and play it safe, trying to create something akin to a trailer for the ballfrog game. So I challenged the status quo and made 
        a parody that puts this swampland inhabitant in the scariest place of all: an office job.<br>
        While not quite a direct parody, it heavily references the business card scene from American Psycho. I quite enjoyed the dynamic between Patrick Bateman and Paul Allen, so the characters are loosely inspired by them.<br>
        If you haven't seen American Psycho, this could best be described as a tired office worker dealing with a nagging coworker. <br>
