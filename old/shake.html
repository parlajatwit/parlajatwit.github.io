        <strong>Shake Art Deluxe</strong> is my most recent publicly released program. You can play it <a class="fancy-link" href="https://studionokoi.itch.io/shake-art-deluxe">here</a>.<br>

        It's an <a class="fancy-link" href="https://github.com/parlajatwit/shake-art-deluxe">open source</a> experimental art tool created in GameMaker Studio 2. <br>
        The lines shake to emulate vertex jitter from the PS1, loosely inspired by the game <a class="fancy-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vib-Ribbon">Vib-Ribbon</a>.

      <p>
        The tool has garnered moderate success. It has roughly ~300k plays across itch.io and Newgrounds. <br>
        You'll notice this tool has "Deluxe" appended to its name. The original Shake Art I created was somewhat popular with Twitter users, but 
        struggled to gain much traffic due to a lack of a way to export images. It was also only black and white, with one line thickness. 
        Users would have to screen record their creations to share them.<br>
        When creating a sequel, I decided to focus first and foremost on adding GIF export so users could share their creations with ease. <br>
        I also added colors, undo/redo functionality, an erase tool, and a smooth way of drawing (in the original you would click to add points, now you can drag).
