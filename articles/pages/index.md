Hey, I'm Jeff!  
I'm a junior studying computer science in Boston. I love working with Python, C, Bash, web technologies, and various game engines. I also enjoy managing Linux systems and writing scripts to automate anything I can.   
Besides computer science, you can find me making 3D art in Blender. I've been doing so for around 3 years now, and I feel it's good to have an art background to supplement programming.   
I'm searching for an internship this spring, so feel free to [reach out](#contact) if anything here interests you. I'm a quick learner and want to dive deep into new technologies and systems!  

You can find my [projects](../projects/index.html) and [art](../art/index.html) below
