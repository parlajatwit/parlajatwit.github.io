[bsml](https://github.com/parlajatwit/bsml) is a simple static site generator using markdown and html templates   
I created this tool so I can easily make a website from markdown files. I always write my notes and miscellaneous information down in markdown format, so this will allow me to easily share my class notes if I choose to do so.   
It also allows users to create blogs easily. The possibilities are endless (though more specialized solutions could come in handy)
