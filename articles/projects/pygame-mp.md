[pygame-mp](https://github.com/pygame-mp/pygame-mp) is an online multiplayer framework for PyGame.  
It abstracts networking concepts to make online games easier to create for the developer.  
pygame-mp is also somewhat of a game engine. There are drawn and static objects, with each having methods to update locally and to send information to the server.  
An example air hockey game is included for demonstration purposes.

Ben and I made this as our final project for Network Programming
