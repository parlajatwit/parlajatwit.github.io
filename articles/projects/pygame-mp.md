[pygame-mp](https://github.com/pygame-mp/pygame-mp) is an online multiplayer framework for PyGame.  
It abstracts networking concepts to make online games easier to create for the developer.  
pygame-mp is also somewhat of a game engine. There are drawn and static objects, with each having methods to update locally and to send information to the server.  
Included on the github is an air hockey game as an example.

Ben and I made this as our final project for Network Programming
