	<p><a href="https://github.com/pygame-mp/pygame-mp">pygame-mp</a> is an online multiplayer framework for PyGame.<br />
It abstracts networking concepts to make online games easier to create for the developer.<br />
It is based off of a client server architecture.<br />
pygame-mp is also somewhat of a game engine. There are drawn and static objects, with each having methods to update locally and to send information to the server.<br />
Included on the github is an air hockey game as an example.</p>
